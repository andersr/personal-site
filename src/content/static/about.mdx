:wave: &nbsp;Hi, and thanks for stopping by. &nbsp;I'm Anders Ramsay, a software engineer based in Brooklyn, NY.  I have worked in the web design and development space for over two decades, wearing many different hats, including Delivery Principal, Senior Software Engineer, Director of UX, and more.  I've worked at multinationals, design agencies, federal contractors, and several startups. Some of my recent projects include [Starling Home](https://www.starlinghome.co/) and [QuickPad](https://www.quickpadapp.com/).  

In my free time, I enjoy üìñ :wine_glass: :ski: :tennis: üèÉ :coffee: :soccer: üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è and spending way too much time on Hacker News. :smile:
