title: Some of My Favorite Shell Commands

If you create a new directory in your terminal, what is your likely next step? Probably cd'ing into the directory.

In other words, you're first doing `mkdir somedir` followed by `cd somedir`.

If I find myself typing something like this on a regular basis, I'll create a custom command for it.

## Create a Directory and `cd` Into It In One Command

Here is the very simple function `mkcd` I created.

```bash
function mkcd
  mkdir -p $argv ; cd $argv
end
```

Now all you need to do is type `mkcd` and you've combined the two steps into one.

The above is written for the [fish shell](https://fishshell.com/). Adding custom commands in Fish is ridiculously trivial. Here is [a great article](https://medium.com/@yowats0n/creating-a-global-function-in-fish-shell-238b571dc6df) describing the process.

If you use a bash shell, your script will look something like this:

```bash
function mkcd() {
  mkdir -p $1 ; cd $1
}
```

And here you can learn about [adding custom commands in bash](https://shanelonergan.github.io/streamline-your-workflow-with-custom-bash-commands/).

Here are a few more custom commands I use quite a bit. They're written for Fish, but should be easy to rewrite for bash.

## New Git Branch

Checking out a new branch with the `-b` modifier in order to create a new branch is not intuitive and a lot to type. I decided I prefer `gnew` instead.

```bash
function gnew
  git checkout -b $argv
end
```

## Delete git branches

Now that we've added branches, we want an easy way to delete them.

```bash
function gbd
  git branch -d $argv
end
```

Now you can just type `gbd first-branch other_branch  FOObranch` and git will attempt to delete them all. I use the lowercase `-d` so Git will tell me if the branch is not fully merged.

## NPM Uninstall

Much faster than typing `npm uninstall`.

```bash
function nu
  npm uninstall $argv
end
```

## Just `g` for git

Since Git is something I use all day, I created what basically is an alias for `git`.

```bash
function g
  git $argv
end
```

Now I can just type `g push` or whatever. I've done the same for other very common commands I type, eg `y` for `yarn` and so forth.

## Git First Push

I like to be able to just type `g push` when I am in a branch, to push new code. However, for that to work I need to tell Git that I want to push to the remote branch matching the name of the branch I am in. Here is a script for doing that.

```bash
function gfpush
  git push --set-upstream origin (git status | head -1 | string split ' ')[-1]  $argv
end
```

Basically, I use this command the first time I push code in a new branch, and after that I can just type `g push`.

Those are a few of my favorites.

## My one tip for creating custom commands

As a closing thought, if you are considering writing your own custom commands, don't do what I did initially, which was to combine way too many things into one command. :cry:

Not surprisingly, the custom commands I use the most are the ones that are simple and do one, or maybe two, things.
