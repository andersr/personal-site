:wave: &nbsp;Hi, and thanks for stopping by. &nbsp;I'm
Anders Ramsay, a software engineer based in Brooklyn, NY. &nbsp;I'm the technical co-founder for a [home maintenance](https://www.starlinghome.co/) venture, where we're working to simplify the process of home upkeep, electrification, and more. &nbsp;Previously, I've worked at multinationals, design agencies, federal contractors, and several startups, where I wore many different hats, including Delivery Principal, Senior Software Engineer, Director of UX, and more.

In my free time, I enjoy üìñ :wine_glass: :ski: :tennis: üèÉ :coffee: :soccer: üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è and spending way too much time on Hacker News. :smile:
